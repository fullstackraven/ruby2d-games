# Mastermind
A Ruby project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind)'s Ruby curriculum. 

Written with the AWESOME [ruby2d](http://www.ruby2d.com/) framework

## Game Description
Mastermind is a two-player code-breaking game where one player creates a code using colored pegs and the other player tries to guess the code within a certain number of turns. There are 6 different colors pegs that form a 4 peg "code" that another player tries to break in 12 guesses. After each guess, the code maker provides feedback in the form of black and white pegs, indicating correct color and position (black) and correct color only (white). The guesser must use this information to make educated guesses until they successfully break the code.

## Instructions
The Mastermind game created here is a 1-player game, that is played in a [Ruby2D](http://www.ruby2d.com/) window. You can opt to be a **code-breaker** and attempt to break the computers generated code, or you can choose be a **code-maker** and create a code for the computer to break. There are additional instructions that will be displayed at the beginning of each game.
