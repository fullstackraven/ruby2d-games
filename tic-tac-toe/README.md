Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game, classically played with paper-and-pencil, in which players take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw. Tic-tac-toe is a simple, quick game that can be played almost anywhere, making it a popular choice for children and adults alike.
